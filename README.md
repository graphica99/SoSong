SoSong is a music streaming platform. User can search through songs,artist,podcast and many more. This application is based on [Deezer developers api](https://developers.deezer.com) which is available to developers. Music plays for only 30 second because of the restrictions on Deezer api for developers.The app is capable of playing any duration of song.
I used a free api for this project because of copywrite issues on most songs. Deezer api takes care of that.

NextJS, React , Sass and vanilla Javascript were some of the technologies used for this project. I used nextJs for SSR(Sever side rendering) React (front end) and sass for styling.

In my future update, I hope to extend the duration of the music and add more features like.

- Add to favorite on the server side
- authentication
- Playlist
